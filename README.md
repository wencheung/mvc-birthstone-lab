### Sinatra Birthstone Lab



The goal of this lab is to create a web application that takes in a user's birth month, and outputs their birthstone. For example, someone born in December should be told that their birthstone is Turquoise.

Don't forget to preview and test your application as you work! After installing the gems once, you will need to run the webapp from your command line to start a server. From there, simply refresh the preview window when you make changes. 



### Bonus Challenges

**1.** Style the results page so it matches the index.

**2.** Make the results page output a picture and a description of the gemstone in addition to the name of the birthstone.

**3.** Create an "About" page with similar styling and link it to the index.

**4.** Make your own web application (remember, it must take input and output manipulated data).
